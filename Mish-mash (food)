'''Mish-mash''' (in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''Миш-маш'') is a [[Bulgarian cuisine|Bulgarian]] spring dish made with fresh vegetables (typically [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Bell pepper|peppers]] and [[Onion|onions]]), eggs and [[Sirene]] (a type of Balkan [[Brined cheese]]) often garnished with freshly cut [[parsley]]. 
There are variations in which [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Scallion|scallions]], [[Eggplant|eggplants]], [[Okra|okras]] or [[Carrot|carrots]] are added to the dish. There are variations without sirene and without onion as well.<ref name="encookbook" /><ref name="cookbook" /><ref name="FED" /><ref name="Zvezdev" /><ref name="balkanfoodrecipes" />

==Preparation, serving and consumption==
Traditionally, mish-mash is made from chopped peppers and tomatoes, which are stewed in hot oil over medium heat. Peppers can be pre-roasted and peeled or cut raw. After that, eggs and feta cheese are added to the mixture to thicken. Parsley is added last, just before putting the mish-mash off heat. It is also possible to prepare the dish in the oven.<ref name="encookbook" /><ref name="cookbook" /><ref name="balkanfoodrecipes" />
It is sometimes convenient to prepare the stewed vegetables beforehand and just add eggs and cheese before consumption.

There is no one recipe for making mish-mash, and many different variations of the dish exist. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMZlDwAAQBAJ&dq=mish-mash+bulgaria&pg=PA56|title=The wines of Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova|first=Caroline|last=Gilby|date=July 9, 2018|publisher=Infinite Ideas|isbn=9781910902820|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ8vWih-rqwC&dq=mish-mash+bulgaria&pg=PA55|title=Bulgaria (Other Places Travel Guide)|first1=Leslie|last1=Strnadel|first2=Patrick|last2=Erdley|date=June 10, 2012|publisher=Other Places Publishing|isbn=9780982261996|via=Google Books}}</ref> However, common ingredients are listed below:
