[[File:Гопкалит.jpg|thumb|Hopcalite]]
'''Hopcalite''' is the trade name for a number of mixtures that mainly consist of oxides of [[copper]] and [[manganese]], which are used as [[catalysts]] for the conversion of [[carbon monoxide]] to [[carbon dioxide]] when exposed to the oxygen in the air at room temperature.

The name "hopcalite" is derived from [[Johns Hopkins University]] - "Hop" and the [[University of California]] - "Cal", where basic research into carbon monoxide was carried out during the First World War and these catalysts were discovered in 1918.<ref name="ME_2" />{{Citation needed|date=November 2021|reason=for the name}}

A variety of compositions are known, such as "hopcalite II" that is approximately 60% [[manganese (IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] and 40% [[copper (II) oxide|copper oxide]] (the MnO<sub>2</sub> : CuO molar ratio is 1.375)<ref name="EN_1" /> and "hopcalite I" that is a mixture of 50% [[MnO]], 30% [[CuO]], 15% [[Cobalt(III) oxide|Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]], and 5% [[Silver oxide|Ag<sub>2</sub>O]].<ref name="EN_1" /><ref name="ME_1" /> Hopcalite has the properties of a porous mass and resembles [[activated carbon]] in its appearance.<ref name="ME_2" />

== Preparation ==
While typically hopcalite catalysts are prepared by [[Calcination|calcining]] intimate mixtures of oxides and carbonates,<ref name="EN_2" /> various techniques have been employed for producing hopcalites in the laboratory and on an industrial scale, such as physical mixing of the (finely divided) metal oxides, co-precipitation of the metal oxides from metal salt solutions (see [[salts]]), thermal decomposition of mixtures of metal nitrates (see [[nitrate]]) and metal carbonates (see [[carbonate]]), one-step synthesis via flame spray pyrolysis from organic and inorganic precursor systems, e.g.<ref name="DE_1" /> Nanophase hopcalite catalysts have also been described.<ref name="EN_3" />

Although hopcalite-based catalysts have been used in practice for decades, many questions regarding their mode of action are still open. This is due to their complex structures, which make it difficult to obtain information about the active centers and the mechanisms of catalysis and deactivation.

== Applications ==
Hopcalite is widely used in personal [[Respiratory protective equipment|respiratory protective equipment (RPE)]] and collective protective equipment, among others.
Different uses of hopcalite catalysts are listed below:

* in some types of gas mask filters designed to protect from carbon monoxide (Soviet-made DP-1, combined filters VK-450, SX (CO) filters, e.g.)
* in air filtration systems and breathing apparatus to purify breathing air supplies, for example those utilised in scuba diving, and firefighting.<ref name="ES_2" />
* used as the main filtration ingredient in the self rescue respirators issued to miners (SPP-4)<ref name="ES_2" />
* filtering self-rescuers designed for use in fire conditions (GDZK-EN, GDZK-U, GDZK-A, e.g.)
* in devices for monitoring the content of carbon monoxide (CO) in rooms
* used as a precaution with submersible air compressors, if they are driven by internal combustion engines (like on ships)

In respiratory protective equipment, hopcalite is used to facilitate the rapid oxidation of the toxic carbon monoxide to [[Carbon dioxide#Toxicity|harmless]] carbon dioxide with the oxygen from the air, which is then chemically bound to a [[sodium hydroxide]] layer, thus eliminating CO from the air stream, (which otherwise is not removed by activated charcoal air filters).<ref name="ES_2"/> Water vapor poisons the hopcalite catalyst, so in order to protect against water vapor, an additional filter based on [[Silica gel]] is introduced. In addition to that, the hopcalite layer is protected by a mechanical filter and a layer of activated carbon, purify the air of other contaminants.<ref name="PL_1" /><ref name="PL_2" /><ref name="PL_3" />
The operation of carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, on the other hand, is based on recording the heat released during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

Although primarily used to catalyze the conversion of CO to CO<sub>2</sub>, hopcalite catalysts are also used to remove [[ethylene oxide]] and other [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]] as well as [[ozone]] from gas streams.<ref name="CS_2" />
In addition, hopcalites catalyze the oxidation of various organic compounds at elevated temperatures (200–500&nbsp;°C).
