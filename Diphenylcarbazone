'''1,5-Diphenylcarbazone''' (or simply '''Diphenylcarbazone''') is a [[chemical compound]] from the group of the carbazones (nitrogen compounds with the basic structure HN=N-CO-NH-NH2).

== Properties ==
Diphenylcarbazone is an orange solid that dissolves well in [[Ethanol]], [[Chloroform]] and [[Benzene]] and is almost insoluble in water.<ref name="TCIEuropeDe" /><ref name="ROnline" /> It forms a [[Coordination complex|purple complex]] compound with [[Mercury (element)|Hg]](II) ions. Likewise, other metal ions, such as [[Chromium|Cr]](III) ions form colored complexes with Diphenylcarbazone. Diphenylcarbazone can be produced from [[Diphenylcarbazide]] via oxidation. Certain commercial products of diphenylcarbazone are a mixture with Diphenylcarbazide, which also forms colored complex compounds with certain metal ions.

== Uses ==
Diphenylcarbazone is used as an indicator for endpoint determination in [[mercurimetry]]: If a [[Sodium chloride]] solution is titrated with [[Mercury(II) nitrate]] solution, undissociated [[Mercury(II) chloride]] is formed. If the end point is exceeded, then the color complex forms with diphenylcarbazone. This method is used in water analysis to determine chloride.
If you add a certain amount of mercury(II) nitrate solution in excess to a chloride solution, you can determine the color intensity of the complex [[Photometry (optics)|photometrically]] and thus deduce the chloride content.
