'''Princesses''' (in Bulgarian: Принцеси) are popular [[Bulgarian cuisine|Bulgarian]] open face baked sandwiches (which are also considered a à la minute dishes) prepared with [[Ground meat|minced meat]], often eaten for breakfast and sold as [[fast-food]]. Both the plural - princesses and the singular - princess are used, to describe many sandwiches and a single sandwich respectively. Often, when prepared at home, there is going to be a plate full of regular (bread slice sized) princesses baked in an oven or an electric grill, but the fast food version is longer - made from a whole bread that has been sliced through its longitude resulting in a loaf-sized sandwich that may or may not be baked on a charcoal barbecue grill. There may or may not be [[kashkaval]] (yellow cheese) on top of the sandwich and people often garnish a princess with [[mayonnaise|mayo]], [[ketchup]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] or [[ljutenica]], depending on their taste.<ref name="flagman" />

Other open face baked sandwiches are also sometimes called princesses in Bulgaria - like princesses with eggs and [[sirene]] or princesses with kashkaval or kashkaval and ham.<ref name="gotvachbg" />

It is also worth mentioning that some people will call the meat princesses, and especially the long ones that are barbecue baked '''Stranjanki'''.<ref name="wiktionary" /><ref name="flagman" />

== Preparation ==

Ground beef is mixed with eggs and finely chopped onion in a bowl, and then garnished with [[black pepper]], [[Summer savory|savory]] and different spices like [[thyme]], [[cumin]], [[coriander]], and [[ginger]] (those vary between recipes) and knead well. If the mixture is not soft enough to spread, an extra egg is added and the mixture is spread over bread slices. Small amount of [[butter]] or [[margarine]] might be spread on top of the bread slices before applying the minced meat in order to make the princesses extra juicy and delicious. The sandwiches are then placed in an oven at medium to high heat and baked for 5 to 10 minutes or until meat is golden and cooked through, after which they are served forth.<ref name="foodcom" /><ref name="gotvachbg" />

[[Sharena sol]] (literally "colorful salt" - a type of spice mix containing salt, savory, [[paprika]] and other spices) and a spread like mayo, ketchup or mustard are common with meat princesses, typically dispensed from a bottle. Different kinds of ljutenica are also eaten with those meat sandwiches.

Other princess variants are made in the same fashion with the only difference being the filling on top. Spreads are not commonly added to those other variants.<ref name="gotvachbg" />

== History ==

Princess sandwiches are a purely Bulgarian invention, as no neighboring country have any similar recipes, and they are a typical socialist dish, most probably invented sometime in the mid-1960s as a clever way to make a satisfying meal without using too much of the expensive at the time meat, and even though they may not be particularly esthetically pleasing, being delicious and easy to make is probably what made these sandwiches popular across the country.<ref name="tacoandtiramisu" /><ref name="dariknews" />

There are different opinions regarding the origin of the name "princess" or "stranjanka", and there is even a somewhat humorous legend involving tsar [[Ivan Asen II]] and a local girl that demanded to be made a princess if she manages to feed the king's starving army, which she did by making those sandwiches.<ref name="flagman" />

The actual origin of the name is different, though. In communist era Bulgaria, it was very common to brand a recipe or a food product after a place - like a town or a mountain for example (marzipan "Liulin", kashkaval "Vitosha" etc.), or after an event or achievement, like for example the chockolites brand "Amphora" that depict the [[Panagyurishte Treasure|Panagyurian gold treasure]] on the box, and in this particular case, the meat sandwiches were branded with the somewhat pom-pose name "Thracian princess", which was a reference to the excavation of the [[Mogilan mound|Mogilan burial mound]] in the center of [[Vratsa]] in 1965–66.<ref name="dariknews" /> Apparently the pretentious name wasn't popular with the people and they were calling it "the princess", and eventually it became known as "a princess", which stuck.
