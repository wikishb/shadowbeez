All three data acquisition methods - physical, file system and logical, are used to backup data from the Windows OS.

Physically extracting data is the process of copying all the data bit by bit, as it appears on the hard disk. Partitions and whole discs are copied in this manner, resulting in a disc image file (like an .ISO). That is why this method is sometimes referred to as an image backup. Those images can be later used to restore the particular partition or disc to a partition or disc. If the physical backup is of the system partition (or includes the system partition?)(usually C:\ in Microsoft Windows), then the backup might be used to restore the OS to a previous state. 
Sometimes the OS might be damaged to the point it won't boot. In this case, having a boot-able recovery media aka recovery USB drive is very helpful. It is the same disc image but with a boot-loader included, that is used to restore the OS.

File system backups are done simply by selecting files and folders to copy (and sometimes selecting files or folders to ignore from the selected), and are full, differential and incremental and file syncs. A full backup is simply a copy of files and folders. On top of a full backup, a differential backup can be performed later, which will back up only files that have been changed since that full backup. Incremental backups, on the other hand will backup only a diff of the file changes - quite like Git works. This is the most compact option, but it takes more time to restore files to a specific state. Finlay, a file sinc will simply overwrite the old file.

Scheduling of backup operations is common, and it is either every x months, weeks, days, or even hours or minutes, or after a specific event (like a new program being installed), or manually triggered. It is common to use a scheme where someone will make a full backup once a month and an incremental or differential backup on top of that full backup every day at x o clock, e.g. The Windows Shadow copy service is used in order to create the backup in the background, while a user is working on the PC and even changing the data on the disc being backed up.
One can also setup the number of backups to be kept. Another interesting feature is the ability to perform particular operation before or after a backup operation - like closing a program, executing command line, etc.

It is also common to have an option to compress and encrypt with a password the backed-up data as well, especially before storing it on the cloud.<ref name="book_1" />

==Data Acquisition Methods==
*Physical – It is a bit-to-bit copy of the device and allow to recover deleted data.
*File system – This method would extract files which are visible at file system level.
*Logical – This method allows extracting particular files from the file system like a backup.
