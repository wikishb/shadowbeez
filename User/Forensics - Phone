There are three places where different data is stored on a smart phone, and those are - the SIM card, the device internal storage and the SD card, if one is used. Some data can also be obtained from the mobile carrier.

SIM (subscriber identity module) cards are comprised of a microprocessor, ROM, and RAM, and are assigned a unique Integrated Circuit Card Identifi er (ICC-ID). The ICC-ID contains the mobile country code (MCC), mobile network code (MNC), and a serial number of the card. These smart cards (SIMs) are used to authenticate users on GSM and UMTS networks. The SIM card contains information relating to the network and user, including an authentication key (called Ki) needed to establish a connection with  the  network,  the  subscriber’s  personal  identification  number  (PIN)  for restricting use of the SIM, and the subscriber’s phone number, which is called the Mobile Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN).The SIM also contains an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) that is uniquely associated with the subscriber and is comprised of a country code, a mobile network code, and subscriber identifi cation number. A SIM card may also contain a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) and  Location Area Identity (LAI). The TMSI is often used over the radio link to avoid revealing the IMSI number to others who may be eavesdropping with radio-related interception equipment. The TMSI and LAI generally change each time a device moves to a new location area within the mobile network.<ref name="book_1" /> 

SIM cards contain a small OS with apps of its own (called cardlets), and an internal storage, with a small file system. SIM cards have storage capacity between 8KB and 512 KB<ref name="ref_3" /> (or 4 to 256 pages of text)<ref name="ref_5" />, and often contain contacts, SMS archive and a list of last dialed numbers.<ref name="ref_2" /><ref name="ref_4" /> Not all of the information stored on a SIM card is known to or easily accessible by the subscriber.<ref name="book_1" />

Feature phones have some kind of basic proprietary OS, while most of the smartphones run Android, iOS or Windows. Smart phones have baseline phone  functionality but are vastly more powerful and extendable, and hence have greater evidentiary value.<ref name="book_1" />
At a minimum, mobile phones can be expected to contain address books, call logs, and Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages. Often photographs, audio, and video are present as well as Internet history, Internet cache, Internet bookmarks, e-mails. There is also a wealth of information in third-party installed applications. 

Some mobile devices record the location of cellular towers they contacted, potentially providing a historical record of the user’s whereabouts over a given period (iPhones). GPS-enabled devices may also contain remnants of past locations and maps and EXIF data embedded in digital photographs can add additional evidentiary value, providing the date and time the photograph was created, the device type used to create it, and potentially the GPS coordinates of where the photograph was taken. Onboard GPS may also provide the user with mapping functionality, and hence provide forensic investigators with waypoints, plotted destinations, and routes taken.


==Data Acquisition Methods==
*Physical – It is a bit-to-bit copy of the device and allow to recover deleted data. (not always possible with mobile)
*File system – This method would extract files which are visible at file system level.
*Logical – This method allows extracting particular files from the file system like a backup.

*SIM
*Handset
*SD Card
