'''1-Phenyl-2-nitropropene''', or simply '''phenyl-2-nitropropene''', or '''P2NP''', as it is commonly referred to, is a [[chemical compound]] from the [[Aromatic compound|aromatic]] group of compounds, with the formula C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. It is a light-yellow crystalline solid with a distinct smell.<ref name="p2npim" /> Phenyl-2-nitropropene is used in the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture the drug [[Adderall]], an [[amphetamine]] mixture used to treat [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]]. P2NP and other similar nitrostyrenes are also employed in the [[Clandestine chemistry|clandestine manufacture of drugs]] of the amphetamine class, and are listed as drug precursors in many countries.<ref name="Erowid" /><ref name="Erowid2" /><ref name="Erowid3" />

==Uses==
In the pharmaceutical industry, P2NP is used to produce a [[Racemic mixture|racemic]] [[amphetamine]] mixture, branded under the trade names [[Adderall]] and [[Adderall|Mydayis]], amongst others. In this case, the double bond is hydrogenated and the nitro group is reduced,<ref name="ru1" /> thus 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene becomes 1-phenyl-2-aminopropane, which is another name for amphetamine. Different reducing agents and solvents are used for this reaction, and various protocols exist. Often [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LAH), [[aluminum amalgam]] or [[Raney nickel]] are used as a reducing agent, and the reaction is carried in a solvent like [[isopropyl alcohol]] or [[THF]]<ref name="ru2" /><ref name="Erowid" /><ref name="Erowid2" />

[[File:Рeduction of P2NP to Amphetamine.png|none|framed|Reduction of P2NP to Amphetamine]]


The above diagram depicts P2NP reduction to amphetamine by using either [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LAH]], [[sodium amalgam]], [[Raney nickel]], or [[Palladium#Catalysis|palladium]] as a catalyst in the reduction. Platinum, in the form of [[Adams' catalyst]], can also be used.<ref name="Erowid" />

P2NP can also be reduced to [[phenylacetone]], which is a precursor in the synthesis of [[methamphetamine]].
In this preparation, phenyl-2-nitropropene is reduced to phenyl-2-nitropropane using [[sodium borohydride]], followed by hydrolysis of the nitro group with [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[potassium carbonate]] to produce phenylacetone (1-phenyl-2-propan-2-one).<ref name="ErowidP2p" /> Phenyl-2-nitropropene can also be reduced by hydrochloric acid and iron, forming an intermediate that will hydrolyze, which will form phenylacetone as well.<ref name="ErowidP2p" />

==Synthesis==
In the lab, phenyl-2-nitropropene is produced by the reaction of [[benzaldehyde]] and [[nitroethane]] in the presence of a basic [[catalyst]] like [[n-butylamine]]. The reaction is a nitroaldol reaction, and is a variant of a [[Knoevenagel condensation|Knoevenagel condensation reaction]], which is one of a broader class of reactions called [[Henry reaction|Henry condensations]], or simply Henry reactions. These are named after the German chemist [[Emil Knoevenagel]], and the Belgian chemist Louis Henry, respectively. 

[[Image:Creation of phenyl-2-nitropropene.svg|left|framed|Synthesis of phenyl-2-nitropropene]]{{clear-left}}

In this type of reaction, the basic catalyst deprotonates the nitroethane to form a [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance stabilized anion]]. This anion nucleophilically adds to the [[aldehyde]] forming a β-nitro alcohol, which is subsequently dehydrated to yield the [[nitroalkene]]. Water is produced as a byproduct, and must be actively removed from the reaction mixture.
Often, primary amines like [[n-butylamine]], [[methylamine]], and [[ethylamine]] are used as catalysts, as is anhydrous [[ammonium acetate]] at times.<ref name="p2npim" />

Many other drugs of the amphetamine class are produced in a similar fashion, where substituted benzaldehyde derivatives are used to produce a different nitrostyrene, which is later reduced to the desired amine. One such reaction is the Knoevenagel condensation of [[piperonal]] with nitroethane, yielding 3,4-methylenedioxy-1-phenyl-2-nitropropene, or MDP2NP. This is reduced to [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]], or MDA, which can be methylated to [[MDMA|3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine]], or MDMA.<ref name="Erowid3" /> Another uses 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde and nitromethane to yield 2,5-dimethoxy-β-nitrostyrene.
Many of these Knoevenagel condensations were used by [[Alexander Shulgin|Dr. Alexander Shulgin]] to yield over 100 amphetamine derivatives, which he detailed in his book, ''[[PiHKAL]]''.<ref name="pihkal" /><ref name="p2npim" /><ref name="Erowid4" />

==Safety and Storage==
P2NP is labeled as harmful by the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|GHS]], and is a known irritant. Thus, breathing fumes and direct skin and eye contact should be avoided.
The [[median lethal dose]] for oral exposure in rats and mice is greater than 500 mg/kg and 1176 mg/kg, respectively.
Based on available data, the classification criteria are not met to classify P2NP as a [[carcinogen]]. However, the toxicological properties have not been thoroughly investigated.<ref name=Cayman /><ref name=Biosynth /><ref name=Sigma />

P2NP should be stored at 2°C to 8°C and away from strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizing agents]]. At higher temperatures, P2NP is not very stable, and degrades with time.<ref name=Biosynth /><ref name="p2npim" />
