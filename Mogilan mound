The '''Mogilan mound''' or '''Mogilanska mound''' is a [[burial mound]] in the center of [[Vratsa]], [[Bulgaria]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://bulgarianheritage.bulgariana.eu/jspui/handle/pub/558#dcId=1639774046479&p=1 |title="Могиланска могила" |website=bulgarianheritage.bulgariana.eu |access-date=January 9, 2022}}</ref>

During excavations in 1965–66, 3 tombs were found in it, built of stone. One of them - tomb No 2, was found intact and yielded a rich treasure-trove of artifacts. 

Tomb No 2 consists of an anteroom and a chamber. In the anteroom there was a chariot and the remains of a sacrificed horse, whose ammunition has a complete set of silver decorations. In the chamber there was a funeral with many treasures: a gold wreath and earrings, a gilded silver knee pad with an image of the [[Mother_goddess|great mother goddess]], a set of magic figurines, as well as different vessels and objects made of silver, bronze and ceramics. Some vessels bear the name of the [[Odrysian_kingdom|Odrysian]] ruler [[Cotys_I_(Odrysian)|Cotys I]]. 

The other two tombs were looted in antiquity and yielded only a small amount of random objects – a gold and silver jug and others. It is likely that prominent members of the ruler dynasty of the [[Triballi]] were buried in those tombs in the 4th century BC.

The artifacts are stored in the regional historical muzeum of Vratsa.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ancient-treasure.info/thracian-treasures/mogilanska-mound-princess.html |title="Mogilanska mound – A Burial of a Thracian princess" |access-date=January 9, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bnt.bg/bg/a/50-godini-zlatno-trakijsko-sa-krovishte-ot-mogilanskata-mogila |title="50 години златно тракийско съкровище от Могиланската могила" |website=bnt.bg |access-date=January 9, 2022}}</ref>
