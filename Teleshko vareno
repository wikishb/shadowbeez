'''Teleshko vareno''' (in Bulgarian: Телешко варено), which literally translates to "veal boiled", is a traditional dish from the [[Bulgarian cuisine]], which consists of [[veal|veal meat]] cut in pieces in a vegetable [[consommé]], made from [[onions]], [[carrots]], [[Bell pepper|red peppers]], [[potatoes]]. It is a type of soup and is often served as a main dish.<ref name="lindas" /><ref name="newr" /><ref name="oldr" /><ref name="bucatarasul" /><ref name="sharemykitchen" /><ref name="myfitnesspal" /><ref name="francoelizabeth" />

==Preparation==
The vegetables are washed well, after which the unnecessary parts are cut off, and instead of being discarded are used in the cooking process, namely - the ends and peels of the carrots, peels of the celery root, celery stalk, parsley stalks and the tops and bottoms from the onion heads. The veal should preferably be [[Shank_(meat)|shank meat]] and should not be de-boned, as the [[bone marrow]] gives significant amount of taste to the broth. The meat is placed in a pot along with the vegetable scrapes, salt, a [[bay leaf]] and some [[black pepper|black pepper berries]], topped with water and boiled to readiness. As the meat boils, the foam is periodically scraped off.<ref name="lindas" /><ref name="newr" /><ref name="oldr" />

While waiting for the meat, the vegetables are cut in big pieces of different shape. If the potatoes are small, they can remain whole or can be cut in halves. Something that is specific to this soup is that the ingredients are in relatively big pieces, especially the meat and the potatoes.<ref name="y8" /><ref name="y9" /><ref name="y11" />

When the meat is ready, it is taken out and is cut into large pieces. The broth is strained through a [[strainer]] or a [[cheesecloth]] in order to make it clear, and the vegetable scrapes are discarded. The chopped vegetables and meat are added to the broth and cooked for additional 20 minutes, after which the potatoes are added and everything is cooked some more. When the potatoes are ready, chopped celery and parsley leaves are added, cooked for a few more minutes and the soup is ready to serve.

Different variations of this soup exist, and sometimes different ingredients are added as well, such as [[cabbage]], [[tomatoes]], [[horseradish]] or [[parsnips]]. [[Sunflower oil]] can be substituted for other [[Vegetable oil]] or [[butter]].<ref name="eatyourbooks" /><ref name="thebalkanfoodie" /><ref name="y3" /><ref name="y7" />
