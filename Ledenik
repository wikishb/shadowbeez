== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

There was a Roman settlement near the modern village, and it is believed that the history of the village located in this area began around 1017. The village is full of stories and traditions.

A Thracian settlement in the "Beli Bryag" locality is registered in the land, and in the "Usoeto" locality 4.5 km south-west there is an early Byzantine fortress noticed by [[Karel_Škorpil|Škorpil]].

=== Middle Ages ===

a medieval church was discovered 1 km to the west, on the high terrain with a large slope towards the Yantra River. According to stylistic features from the found fresco fragments, the church dates from the second half of the 12th century. Traces of a settlement around the church have not been found.

According to legend, the village during the Second Bulgarian Kingdom was in the area "Disagite", around a lush spring, now captured as a fountain. It remained there until the first years of Ottoman rule. Sometime in the second half of the 17th century, with the construction of the [[Bey]] Tower, it moved to its present location. <ref name=":0" />

=== Ottoman rule ===

In the Turkish tax register from 1430 there is a village called Ledenik, which is recorded as a [[Timar|timar]] of Sayyaklu Bayazid and has 1 Muslim, 47 Christian families and 2 widows.<ref name=":0" /> In 1638 there were 42 Christian men in the village. <ref>[http://www.uni-vt.bg/pages/5117/uplft/T10_494-615.pdf Овчаров, Тодор, „Старини в землището на село Шемшево“]</ref>

=== After the Liberation ===

With an administrative act of 17.12.1955 the village of Shemshevo was annexed to the village of Ledenik. This fact changed on August 26, 1991, when the village of Shemshevo again became an independent settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nsi.bg/nrnm/index.php?f=6&ezik=bul |title= Справка в Националния регистър на населените места (НРНМ)}}</ref>

== Culture ==
=== Legend of Shemshi Bay ===
The legend <ref> [http://agrovestnik.com/леденик-разказа-легенди-за-трагична/ Леденик tells legends about tragic love in the style of "Romeo and Juliet ..."], Lilia Lozanova - in agrovestnik.com, 13.03 .2015 </ref> tells that the only son of the [[bey]] fell in love with the beautiful Bulgarian girl Neda. Worried about their daughter's fate, the parents turned to the old witch doctor Mina for advice and she gave the girl an herb that put the girl to sleep so deep that she looked dead.

Not wanting to believe the rumor about the "death" of his beloved, the master's son went to her parents' house. Seeing his beloved оне in a coffin, the young man shot himself in the heart. It was not long before the old bey appeared in the house, mourning the death of his son. Awaiting revenge, the parents accepted the new guest with fear. The wise master not only did not take revenge, but also gave money for their daughter's funeral.

Late in the evening, Neda, who had already woken up, went secretly to Tarnovo, but on leaving the village they were seen by a man from Ledenik and the rumor about the resurrected girl spread through the village and reached the ears of the bey, who, overwhelmed with suspicion, ordered that the girl's grave be dug up. The coffin was full of stones and the deceit was discovered. All of the girl's relatives were slaughtered in the "Asha Chair" locality under the village of Shemshevo.

Learning of the tragedy that befell his family, the brother gathered his party and attacked the bey's retinue. The boy failed to reach his former master, who was scared and decided to move to Tarnovo. This is the story of the last bay to inhabit the building. From that moment on, the Glaciers began to call the building the Tower.

=== Ethnographic Museum ===
The fortified residential [[Tower_of_Ledenik|Shemshi Bay Tower]] from 1650 on Mela Hill has been turned into an ethnographic museum.

=== St. George's Church ===
Consecrated in 1835, it is among the oldest in the Veliko Tarnovo diocese. Later it was expanded and a balcony was added. Painted by [[Zahari Zograf]], there is a self-portrait of him at the southern entrance of the church behind the door. <ref> {{Cite news | url = http://ekcarevec.com/view.php?id=5046 | title = "The last self-portrait of Zahari Zograf was found in a church in the village of Ledenik"}} </ref>

The painter probably did his work before he started painting the church in [[Transfiguration Monastery | Transfiguration Monastery]] and the famous "Wheel of Life".

The village celebrates the day of the patron saint of the church "St. George" on May 6 ([St. George's Day]). A carnival is held in the center of the village that everyone can enjoy and have fun.

=== [[Chitalishte]] "Lesson - 1920" ===
Supports 2 art formations - a mixed folk chorus and the "Ledeniк grandmas" formation<ref> {{cite web | url=https://www.veliko-tarnovo.bg/bg/kultura-i-turizm/kulturni-institucii/narodni-chitalisha-v-obshina-veliko-tarnovo/chitalishe-pouka-1920/ | title = Chitalishte "Pouka - 1920"}} on the website of the Municipality of Veliko Tarnovo </ref> and carries out support activities in its information center.

== Landmarks ==

The architectural atmosphere of the [[Bulgarian_National_Revival|Renaissance era]] is preserved in the village - old houses on 1-2 floors, with stone foundations and veranda. They are located mainly in the older western part of the village. The most important landmarks are:

* An ancient 17th-century residential tower, known as the [[Tower_of_Ledenik|Shemshi Bay Tower]], is located on the rocky Mela hill, cut like a peninsula into the Yantra River. During the modern partial restoration of the tower a hotel was built, and the tower itself has been made an ethnographic museum on 3 floors.
* The St. George Church, consecrated in 1835, is one of the oldest in the Veliko Tarnovo diocese.
* The Ledenik hydroelectric power plant was built in 1929. It has low power - less than 1 kW.
